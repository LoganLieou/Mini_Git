# Mini Git

The goal of this project is to sort of make a replica of git from scratch some
features will probably be missing but I want to make something which is pretty
usable, i.e. branching, merge conflicts, commit, and push

## TODO

- [ ] Move `init` and write tests for everything (wow I actually already have tech debt)
- [ ] Add a build file LOL
